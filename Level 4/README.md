# ARL 4: Evaluating robustness against unforeseen adversarial attacks in limited context


## UAR
Testing of models for Unforeseen Adversarial robustness (UAR) is a concept where a set of adversarial attack of a certain type and size (where the set is comprehensive to unforeseen adversarial robustness) are tested on a model and compared to with a selected hardened defended model that is used as a benchmark by the authors.

## Adopting code from UAR
The authors have codes from github that we can adopt, but mainly we will use the codes that crafts the respective adversarial attacks in unforeseen circumstances.
